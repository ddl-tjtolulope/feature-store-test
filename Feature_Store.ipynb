If we don’t do that, we will get a difference between training and serving, and the model predictions will not be as good.\n",

If the clients requesting predictions will not know the feature values, then we need a mechanism to inject the feature values into incoming prediction requests. The feature store plays that role. For example, one of the features of a dynamic pricing model may be the number of web site visitors to the item listing over the past hour. The client (think of a mobile app) requesting the price of a hotel will not know this feature’s value. This information has to be computed on the server using a streaming pipeline on clickstream data and inserted into the feature store. You can also imagine that if you have to fetch a lot of data, this cannot be done quick enough.\n",

        "* The second situation is to prevent unnecessary copies of the data. For example, consider that you have a feature that is computationally expensive and is used in multiple ML models.
